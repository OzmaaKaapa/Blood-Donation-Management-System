# Blood-Donation-Management-System
Our project goal is to make the communication process easier for the blood donor and the patient. 
User can search for blood by blood group, they can submit a blood request and can donate also. 
We also make a list of all the blood banks available in our country and how many units of blood available in those blood bank. 

We are currently doing the web version of it. Our future plan is to delevop a app for this.
